### sudo apt autoremove -y && sudo apt autoclean -y 
	sudo pacman -Sc			

					SYNC OPTIONS (APPLY TO -S)
								 -c, --clean
										 Remove packages that are no longer installed from the
										 cache as well as currently unused sync databases to
										 free up disk space. When pacman downloads packages, it
										 saves them in a cache directory. In addition, databases
										 are saved for every sync DB you download from and are
										 not deleted even if they are removed from the
										 configuration file pacman.conf(5). Use one --clean
										 switch to only remove packages that are no longer
										 installed; use two to remove all files from the cache.
										 In both cases, you will have a yes or no option to
										 remove packages and/or unused downloaded databases.

										 If you use a network shared cache, see the CleanMethod
										 option in pacman.conf(5).
